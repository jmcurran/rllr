This package attempts to recreate the functionality found in the Python package
[pyllr](https://github.com/bsxfan/PYLLR/). That is cost of log-likelihood ratios ($C_{llr}$, calibration of
log-likelihood ratios, and empirical cross entropy plots (ECE) plots. The aim is to be able to produce the type of plots
that [Daniel Ramos](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~dramos/) does for his speaker recognition work, and that has been used in
other areas such as the interpretation of fingerprints and glass evidence. pyllr is authored by by Niko Br&umml;mmer,
David van Leeuwen and Albert Swart. I would expect this to be similar, if not the same, as Daniel's implementations plus
or minus rounding errors.
